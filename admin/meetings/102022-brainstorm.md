### Ideas:

1) General Shared Professional Dictionary
> - ##### What is it? 
> - ###### A database for terms or jargon from majors at an undergraduate level, such as CS or EE, or any liberal art majors. It has a publicly maintained version and any individuals could have their own dictionary by pulling an entry from the public database to their local machine. While the publicly maintained version requires qualified people to update or modify the term and requires professionals to verify, on individuals’ local machine, they can make their own notes or create relationships with another term, making it their own version. The database’s scope could be confined to UCSD courses. For example, Each dictionary entry could be tagged with the course number. And users could filter the database by the course number to get all the terms covered in the course. 
> - C: Create a dictionary term. 
> - R: People access it remotely or pull for their own version. 
> - U: Public database term updated. Or users make notes on their own dict. 
> - D: Delete an entry, either in public database or personal database. 


2) Recipes Page
> - ##### What is it? 
> - ###### A site where users can search up cooking recipes and actively interact with them through stars, comments, reviews, etc.. So like yelp except with cooking recipes. The user can also upload their own recipes.
> - C: Create their own recipe posts.
> - R: Users can get recipes into their local device so that they can make altercations and repost their own remixed version.
> - U: User can update the recipe dataset by adding their own recipes. Also, they can change/edit/update their published recipes(and comments/reviews).
> - D: Users can delete anything they make. (recipes, reviews, saved drafts, etc…)


3) Music Page
> - ##### What is it? 
> - ###### A site where users can search up music recipes and actively interact with them through stars, comments, reviews, etc.. So like yelp except with music. The user can also upload their own music(or even audiobooks, etc..)
> - C: Create their own music/audio.
> - R: Users can download music into their local device so that they can make altercations and repost their own remixed version. So they can add their own vocals, add instruments, etc to their remixed version.
> - U: User can update the music dataset by adding their own music. Also, they can change/edit/update their published posts(and comments/reviews).
> - D: Users can delete anything they make. (music, reviews, saved drafts, remixes, etc…)


4) Journal entries
> - ##### What is it? 
> - ###### This is a CRUD app where users can create journal entries on events or personal thoughts throughout time. These entries can be tagged and grouped to help the user identify relationships or trends in their thoughts or feelings. Allows for the organization of thoughts chronologically but also through other factors (like common events or feelings) as the user sees fit. 
> - ###### Why: This idea is local-first and holds data created solely by the user. Innovative in that this idea is not too commonly implemented and yet leaves room for features for the app to assist the user in their documentation and organization of entries.
> - C: Journal entries about mental health and personal events. Place tags about the general idea of the entry to give it a theme.
> - R: Review entries and find similarities between entries over time. 
> - U: Categorize entries based on tags and related events. Draw relationships and trends from tags and themes.
> - D: Delete/archive outdated entries as events pass on or lose importance.


5) Quizlet
> - C: Create your own decks (localfirst) with a variety of question/answer templates and options. Fill in blanks, matching, flashcard, etc. Sort items in deck to gather data on what topics you know best/worst and what you need to review the most. Share online if you want
> - R: Read and try out other peoples study decks. Download and make your own local changes to other peoples decks!
> - U: Update decks as you learn more and sync changes to online. Update your own version of other peoples decks
> - D: Delete decks you don’t want anymore


6) Shopping list
> - ##### What is it? 
> - ###### The shopping list is an application where users can create a list of items that they normally shop for in stores and curate their shopping lists as and when they need to go to the store. An additional feature is looking up items and lists that others are using (that they published publicly).
> - C: Shopping list with items.
> - R: People can read the publicly available lists of others and learn about new stores and items.
> - U: Update lists and frequently purchased items.
> - D: Delete items that are no longer available or lists that are no longer in use.


### Final Consensus:
> #### 1) General Shared Professional Dictionary
> #### 2) Journal Entries
> #### 3) Backups: Recipes Page, Quizlet
#### From our group discussion and votes, we have chosen to pursue a General Shared Professional Dictionary site to propose to our T.A.
