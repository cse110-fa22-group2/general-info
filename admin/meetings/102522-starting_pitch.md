> ***Project Theme*** - Local First. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete

> ***Group Project*** - The project we are choosing to pursue is the General Shared Professional Dictionary.
>- **What is it?**
>- *A database for terms or jargon from majors at an undergraduate level, such as CS or EE, or any liberal art majors. It has a publicly maintained version and any individuals could have their own dictionary by pulling an entry from the public database to their local machine. While the publicly maintained version requires qualified people to update or modify the term and requires professionals to verify, on individuals’ local machine, they can make their own notes or create relationships with another term, making it their own version. The database’s scope could be confined to UCSD courses. For example, Each dictionary entry could be tagged with the course number. And users could filter the database by the course number to get all the terms covered in the course.*
>- **C:** Create a dictionary term.
>- **R:** People access it remotely or pull for their own version.
>- **U:** Public database term updated. Or users make notes on their own dict.
>- **D:** Delete an entry, either in public database or personal database.


> Tonight we will discuss baisc features and the structure of the webpage. We will then discuss the requirments for the Project Pitch.
